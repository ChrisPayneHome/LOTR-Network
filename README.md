##  Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This project utilises NLP and network analysis to produce a character relationship network for the Lord of the Rings book series. This project was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/thu-vu92/the_witcher_network">this repo</a> which conducted this analysis for the characters in the Witcher book series.

## Files <a name="files"></a>

### Character Names <a name="characters"></a>

This project relies heavily upon the JSON file of character names taken from <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/lord-of-the-rings-names">here</a>. Although if a better list is available, we should use that list.

### Books <a name="books"></a>

The Books folder contains text files of the three books:

 * The Fellowship of the Ring 
 * The Two Towers 
 * The Return of the King

### LOTR Network Notebook <a name="notebook"></a>

This is a notebook that conducts all the analysis and produces any plots/data athat will be used later.
